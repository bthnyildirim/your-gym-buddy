## **Game Overview**

In Your Gym Buddy, the player controls a character who must avoid falling dumbbells (obstacles) while trying to collect prizes that increase the player's score. The game becomes progressively more difficult as more obstacles appear. The game ends when the player collides with an obstacle.

## **Features**

- **Player Movement**: Control the character using arrow keys (`Left Arrow` and `Right Arrow`).
- **Obstacles**: Dumbbells fall from the top of the game board, and the player must dodge them.
- **Prizes**: Random prizes appear periodically that increase the player's score when collected.
- **Scoring System**: The player gains points for every prize collected. The score is displayed at the end of the game.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the player collides with an obstacle.

## **How to Play**

1. **Movement**:
   - Use the `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight` keys to move the character left and right across the board.
2. **Objective**:

   - Avoid the falling dumbbells.
   - Collect prizes to increase your score.

3. **Game Over**:

   - The game will end if you collide with a dumbbell, and you'll be redirected to the game over screen.

4. **Winning**:
   - There is no specific "win" condition; the goal is to collect as many prizes as possible before crashing into an obstacle.
